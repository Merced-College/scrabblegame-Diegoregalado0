After playing around with the code and various trial and error attempts, 
I can say that this program was a fun, interesting process and a learning experience.

At first, I was having a bit of trouble finding where to start, as usual.
I then briefed OpenAI's ChatGPT 4o with the main objective of the program with the context and details.
I received a response with some basic frameworks and a solid starting point.

Then I began making my classes, constructors and algorithms...

I had mostly no issues on that part, aside from some syntax mistakes. 

Where I had the most issues were with the testing of the file, I added a ton of words to the list,
but somehow I could never land on the right combination.
GenerateRandomLetters() chose random letters from Aâ€“Z, which often produced combinations like [q, x, z, j]
Which had no valid words consistenly.

So I created a function that builds a pool of letters only from actual words in the Collins dictionary file.

The way it worked, was instea of generating random words A-Z, it would pull words from the collins file.

Overall although slightly stresfull, I had fun learning the implemtation of ArrayLists and algoritms in practice.
